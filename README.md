How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding what the end user expects from the software I am designing and coding helps to reverse engineer the project. User stories help to add context to user expectations and help software developers envision different scenarios in which their program might be used. This can help to build a system with more robust features that the end user may not have even thought to ask for.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I think that the incremental approach that agile brings to software development is incredibly useful. No one can plan for every contingency and the flexible nature of agile processes helps to mitigate the effects of issues that may arise during the development process. Semper Gumby!

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
The same attributes that make a good team member in other contexts are the attributes needed to be a good team member in software development. Clear communication is paramount. The ability to ask for help in a timely manner can prevent many issues. The ability to say "I don't know" is also a great attribute. Realizing and working within one's limitations while communicating needs to other team members in an effective timely manner coupled with the ability to take and integrate criticism help make for an excellent team member.
